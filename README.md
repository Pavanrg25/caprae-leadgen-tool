# Caprae LeadGen Tool

This project is part of Caprae Capital’s AI Pre-Screening Challenge.

It simulates a lead generation tool that:
- Takes a small list of sample companies
- Enriches each company with fake email and LinkedIn contact info
- Saves the enriched leads as a CSV file

## How to Run

1. Open `leadgen-tool.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially.
3. The enriched lead data will be saved as `leads.csv` in the project folder.
