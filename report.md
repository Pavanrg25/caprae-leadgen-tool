# Caprae LeadGen Tool — Project Report

## Objective

Build a simple lead generation tool within 5 hours to demonstrate the ability to understand business needs, develop technical solutions, and produce actionable output.

## Approach

- Created a small dataset of sample companies with names and domains.
- Developed an enrichment function that generates fake CEO email addresses and LinkedIn URLs based on company data.
- Used Python’s pandas library to organize the enriched data into a DataFrame.
- Exported the data to a CSV file for easy use by sales teams or CRM systems.

## Why This Matters

This tool showcases:
- Understanding of lead generation workflows.
- Ability to enrich raw company data into actionable sales leads.
- Delivery of clear, usable output formats.
- Scalability for future enhancements such as real web scraping, API integration, lead scoring, and automation.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real data sources for enrichment (LinkedIn APIs, email finders).
- Add filtering and prioritization based on lead quality.
- Build a user-friendly UI/dashboard for managing leads.
- Automate reporting and CRM integration.
